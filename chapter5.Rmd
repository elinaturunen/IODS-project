#### Part 1 

read data  
human2 <- read.table("human2.csv", sep = ",", header=TRUE)  

str(human2)  
dim(human2)

The data it is a combination of two datasets and it concerns human development and gender inequality. The data has 9 variables and 155 observations. There are 155 countries. The variables are the ratio of female and male populations with secondary education, the ratio of labor force participation of females and males, expected years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, gross national income per capita, maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate and share of females in parliament.

The variables have different scales and are distributed not very evenly. They describe differences between countries and their development. For example there are a few countries that have high maternal mortality ratio, but the variable of adolescent births is a bit more varied as there are quite many countries where women ages 15-19 give birth. It seems to be common that females ratio of labor force participation to males is 0,5-1 that is the number of females working (officially) compared to men is half or more. Share of women in parliament is quite varied, most countries having under half of the seats taken by women.

Strongest correlations can be found in these: When expected education years grow also life expectancy at birth grow. When expected education years grow maternal mortality and adolescent birth rate decrease. There is also strong negative correlation between life expectancy at birth and maternality mort and adolescent birth rate. And positive correlation between maternal mortality and adolescent birth rate. 

There is also correlation between many other variables. These are traditional variables for measuring development. The variables labor ratio and share of women in parliament are not so strongly correlated with other variables.

![](std pca human2 2.png)  

  
  In the first plot it seems that the GNI per capita would explain most of the variance. That is because the scales of the variables differ a lot and GNI per capita has greatest values and variation of all the variables so it gets disproportionate impact. It is hard to separate other variables from each other (at least in my picture). They seem to be on the same line and correlated. 

In the second plot where the variables are standardized to same scale it seems that there are many relatively strong components explaining variance. In the standarized plot the first principal component PC1 captures the maximum amount of variance from the features in the original data that is 53,6 %. This combination of variables capture most essential dimensions of the data. Maternal mortality, adolescent birth, life expectancy at birth, expected education years, education ratio and GNI per capita contribute to PC1. Maternity, life expectancy, education and GNI related variables explain most of the variance from the features in the human development data that is human development measured with these terms.

The second principal component PC2 captures maximum amount of variability left. Labor ratio and share of women in parliament contribute to PC2. They had only small correlation with other features in previous part of the exercise. Here 
they explain 16,2 % of the variance. 

It might be that for example education is more directly influencing gender equality issues than share of women in parliament which is perhaps higher in more developed states. The ratio of labor force participation of females and males could be not explaining the variance so much, because labor force participation of women in developing countries could be low or high depending on other factors like culture and sectors of economy. This is just guessing.

The variables on the x-axis, PC1, have quite small angle between them so they are highly correlated with each other. The variables on the y-axis, PC2, have a bit greater angle between them so they are correlated with each other but a bit less. The correlation between the features and pc axis is quite strong with all the features I think. Lengths of the arrows tell about the standard deviations of the features. For example the labor ratio has greater deviation than share of women in parliament.

The tea dataset concerns different ways of drinking tea. There are 36 variables and 300 observations in the tea dataset. The variables include for example where and when one drinks tea, how (e.g. with sugar) and how much, reasons for drinking and undertanding of what it is like. There are also some socio-economic variables included.

It seems that dimension 1 explains 11,7 % of the variance and dimension 2 9,11 % of the variance. I chose variables describing how much tea use is specialised e.g. whether one goes to special tea shop instead of chain store that I thought might be slightly similar with each other. Therefore it is understandable that these variables do not catch much of the variance. 

Tea shop and unpackaged tea are not close to other categories, so there is not so strong link between them. Also tearoom, going to chain stores and tea shops and using tea bags and unpackaged tea have a slightly greater distance from other categories. It seems that there is a number of users that differentiate from the mass. 

The variable where has strongest squared correlation between variables and dimensions. In the variables the strongest categories are for dimension 1 chain store and dimension 2 tea shop. Does it mean that they are explain the variance a bit more than other variables?

Also p_upscale, chain store+tea shop, tearoom and tea shop contribute a lot to dimension 1 and chain store+tea shop and p_upscale contribute a lot to dimension 2. So they also explain the variance more than other categories?
